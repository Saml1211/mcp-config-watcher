## About MCP Config Watcher

MCP Config Watcher is a tool designed to monitor MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations and automatically generate documentation for them. It watches the MCP settings file for changes and updates a markdown file with information about the configured servers and their available tools.

The tool is particularly useful for maintaining up-to-date documentation about MCP servers, which provide external capabilities to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol.
